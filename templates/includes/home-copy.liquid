<p>Riding a bike offers many health benefits. Here are just a few:</p>
<ul>
  <li>increased cardiovascular fitness</li>

  <li>increased balance and flexibility</li>
  <li>increased endurance and stamina</li>
  <li>reduced stress</li>

</ul>
<p>As per NHS it's a low-impact type of exercise, so it's easier on your joints than running or other high-impact aerobic activities. But it still helps you get into shape.
For example, someone who weighs 80kg (12st 9lb) will burn more than 650 calories with an hourâ€™s riding, and tone their legs and bottom. If you ride up hills or off-road, you'll also work your upper body.
