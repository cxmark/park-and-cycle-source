park-and-cycle
==============


# What is this?

Park and cycle is a hackday project from Bristol City Council, with the simple idea of helping nudge people who traditionally use park and ride services to cycle to their destination once they've parked.

# How does it work?

We use gmaps.js to power our interface and a simple json file that represents Bristol's park and ride locations.
